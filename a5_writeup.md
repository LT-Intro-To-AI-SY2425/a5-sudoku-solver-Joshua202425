# Assignment 5 Write up

Assignment 5 can be broken up into the following parts:
1. Import the Necessary Modules:
- `copy`: For creating deep copies of objects
- `Stack` and `Queue`: Custom implementations for DFS and BFS operations
2. Utility Functions: 
- `remove_if_exists`: Removes a specified element from a list if it exists, which is used to remove the possibilites from a cell
3. Board Class:
- Represents the Sudoku board
- Consists of functions that will find the most constrained cell, and update the board, which eliminates possible solutions
4. DFS & BFS Functions:
- `DFS`: Uses depth-first search to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It works by trying to fill the most constrained cell with potential values until a solution is found or backtracks if a mistake is made
- `BFS`: Uses breadth-first search to solve the Sudoku puzzle in a similar fashion to DFS but explores nodes level by level
5. Main Execution:
- Defines two different sets of initial moves for Sudoku puzzles
- Uses both DFS and BFS to solve each puzzle and prints the results


After completing the assignment, answer the following reflection questions:

## Reflection Questions

1. How do the performance and efficiency of the Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms compare when solving Sudoku puzzles? In what scenarios might one approach be preferable over the other?
DFS went through the sudoku puzzles faster than the BFS. Although in in deifferent scenarios the BFS would be ebtter for more simple puzzles while the DPS would be more effcient in solving more difficult puzzles.


2. How did the choice of data structures (like the Stack for DFS and Queue for BFS) impact the implementation and functionality of the algorithms? Are there alternative data structures or design patterns that could have been used to achieve the same objectives?

The data structures didn't impact the implementation or the functionality of the algorithms at all. I don't know if there are other data structures or design patterns that could solve; they way this assignment said to do it is the only way I can think of.


3. Considering the current implementation, how might the Sudoku solver be adapted or extended for larger puzzles or different types of grid-based logic games? How can the lessons learned from this assignment be applied to real-world problem-solving or optimization challenges?
The Sudoku solver could be etended to solving other games such as mind sweeper since the algorithm used eliminate options in the row and columns in a sudoku could be used to eliminate the potential spots where the mines could be. The lessons in this assignment could used in optimization challenges to figure which method is best for certain situations and how to create those methods piece by piece as effciently as possible.
